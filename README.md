# GeMOVA 
The generative modeling landscape has grown rapidly, encompassing a wide array of architectures—VAEs, GANs, diffusion models, flow-based approaches, and transformers. This proliferation has made it challenging to maintain a coherent view of the field’s structure and evolution. We introduce GeMOVA (Generative Models Visual Atlas), an interactive, open-source tool designed to map the ecosystem of generative models through a rich, graph-based interface. GeMOVA goes beyond categorization by capturing fine-grained semantic relationships between models—such as variation, evolution, component usage, inspiration, and methodological similarity. Users can explore models chronologically, thematically, or by influence, with direct access to key papers, summaries and Implementations. GeMOVA serves both as an educational reference and a research companion, and is designed to evolve with community contributions.
